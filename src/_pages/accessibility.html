<h1>Accessibility & Responsiveness</h1>

<p>
	Accessibility matters, including in digital spaces. I try to conform to <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">WCAG 2 standards</a> to the best of my ability. I also try to
	make the site responsive across desktop and mobile devices.
