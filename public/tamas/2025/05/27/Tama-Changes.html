			<div class="content"><p>Yesterday was Memorial Day, and I spent it with family. During a lull in the activities, I checked on my tamas to find v3 Japan had turned into flying egg. =( I will put away that shell and focus on v1 Green Squares until summer break. That’ll give me a few weeks to get a few generations deep into the growth chart. During summer break, I’ll put aside v1 Green Shells to participate in some local group hatches and possibly explore some Japanese releases.</p>
