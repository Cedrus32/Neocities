This is a repository for my personal Neocities website. I'm just farting around and have no idea what I'm doing. =)

I've been kicking around this idea for a long time. My goal upon starting this project is to maintain a creative outlet for my interests from the ground up -- from the design and creation of the website, to the topics discussed on that website.
