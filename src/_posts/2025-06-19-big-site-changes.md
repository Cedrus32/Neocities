I have been very busy refactoring this site to be disability- and mobile-friendly. Checkout the <a href="/about/site">accessibility section</a> on the "About" page.

My offline job centers around accessibility for all means and abilities. I didn't want this space to be a barrier to the people and communities I work with every day. Their access matters.

There are features I haven't implemented yet but it's been A LOT of work, and I feel like this is a good rest point for me.

I've been neglecting my other projects, namely my goal of knitting one sweater for each person in my family (4 total) before Christmas. Summer break is my chance to do it, so I'm hoping to tackle that next, while posting updates on tama runs as they happen. I plan to pick up the accessibility to-do list in the fall.
