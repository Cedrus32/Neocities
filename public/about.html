<h2>TLDR: I go by Cedrus online. I started this site as a fun hobby to show off my other hobbies. =)</h2>
<p
	>Hey there, I'm Cedrus! I've dabbled in many hobbies over the years, but a few constants have always been video games, knitting, tamagotchis, and web dev. This site is a coalescing of these
	favorite hobbies into a single space online. A place to practice and show off what I love!</p
>
<p
	>My first video game memory was watching my dad play Doom on the family computer way back in the '90s. I eventually discovered my parents' Super Nintendo, and spent many hours playing Super Mario
	Bros, Star Fox, and A Link to the Past. Nowadays, I enjoy slow-paced, story-driven, and retro-inspired games.</p
>
<p
	>Also in the '90s, I received my first virtual pet -- a pink Komputer Koala GigaPet. I discovered and fell in love with Tamagotchis when the Connections first released in the early '00s, and I
	still love to play and collect the Connections today.</p
>
<p
	>I began dabbling in web dev in the early-mid '00s thanks to Neopets. From that, I fell into the world of pixel sharing and collecting. At one point I was even offered a hosted sub-domain in a
	pixel site ring. I maintained that site for a few years until life pulled me in other directions. Amazingly, I saved my layouts (<a href="#layouts">see below</a>) and pixels (<a
		href="/collections/adoptables"
		>adopt here</a
	>) from that site!</p
>
<p
	>I started knitting in college as a de-stresser. Since then, I've successfully tackled a variety of garments for myself and loved ones -- scarves, socks, mittens, shawls, cowls, hats, and
	sweaters! I have a stash problem, and have gone on a self-imposed yarn buying ban. I'm currently on a journey to knit through my stash.
</p>
<p>Out of all the pages on the web, it's amazing you found this one. Thanks for taking the time to look around!</p>
<p> All the best -- Cedrus </p>
