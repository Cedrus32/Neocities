I've acquired several new Tamagotchis.

Guts Summer was difficult to find, but I managed it! I want to run this is the tama (along with Guts Swimming, currently en route) over summer break.

I was drawn to the bright yellow and TMGC logo on the Lemon Yellow shell. It reminds me of my old-school Neopets username, too. Very nostalgic.

Pearl Purple was an impulse buy. Purple being my favorite color, and being a shiny shell, I vibed with it. I made a lowball offer and the seller accepted!

Pochitchi Comic completes the Oritama comic book shells (not including special editions). Yay!
